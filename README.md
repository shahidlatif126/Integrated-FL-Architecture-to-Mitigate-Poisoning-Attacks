**Utilized Dataset IDSIoT2024** <br>
In the proposed framework, we used A real time dataset "IDSIoT2024. It can be accessed from IEEE Dataport. <br>
[IDSIoT2024 Dataset](https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/real-time-dataset-idsiot2024) <br>

A detailed description of the dataset is available in the article.
[A Real-World Dataset “IDSIoT2024” for Machine Learning/Deep Learning Based Cyber Attack Detection System for IoT Architecture](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10914935) <br>

The preprocessed version of IDSIoT2024 Dataset can be accessed from Google Drive. <br>
